üèòÔ∏è California Housing Price Prediction Project ‚Äî Overview & Explanation
üîç What is This Project?
The California Housing Price Prediction Project is a classic machine learning regression task based on the California Census Housing Dataset. The objective is to build a model that can predict the median house value (i.e., price) in a given neighborhood (block) based on several features like location, income level, population, and housing characteristics.

üìä Dataset Summary
The dataset contains data from the 1990 California census, with 20,640 samples. Each row represents one district or block in California, and includes:

Feature	Description
longitude	Geographic longitude of the district
latitude	Geographic latitude of the district
housing_median_age	Median age of houses in the district
total_rooms	Total number of rooms in all houses in the district
total_bedrooms	Total number of bedrooms
population	Total population in the district
households	Number of households
median_income	Median income of residents (in tens of thousands)
median_house_value	Median house price in the district (Target variable)
ocean_proximity	Categorical: how close the district is to the ocean

üß† Project Workflow (Steps Explained)
1. Load the Data
Data is loaded using fetch_california_housing() or from CSV files.

It is examined for structure, missing values, and types.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Plots and summary statistics are used to understand:

Distributions of features (e.g., income, room counts).

Correlation with target variable (median_house_value).

Geographical plots show housing prices vary by region.

3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values (e.g., impute missing bedrooms).

Feature scaling using StandardScaler (important for models like SVM).

Encode categorical features (ocean_proximity) using OneHotEncoder.

Create custom transformers with ColumnTransformer and Pipeline.

4. Feature Engineering
Add new useful features like:

rooms_per_household

population_per_household

bedrooms_per_room

These ratios often capture better relationships than raw features.

5. Train/Test Split
Split the dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) sets using train_test_split.

Also create a stratified sampling based on income for balanced representation.

6. Model Selection & Training
Try multiple models:

Linear Regression (baseline)

Decision Trees

Random Forest (ensemble)

Support Vector Machines (SVR)

Use cross-validation to evaluate model generalization.

7. Model Evaluation
Evaluate models using:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Cross-validation scores

GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., SVR C, gamma)

8. Prediction & Visualization
Visualize model predictions vs actual values.

Plot residuals and errors.

Highlight geographic trends in prediction error.

9. Pipeline Integration
Build a full end-to-end pipeline with Scikit-learn‚Äôs Pipeline and ColumnTransformer.

This ensures that preprocessing and model training are done in a clean, reusable way.
